**Hello**

On 29 April, 2019, SDSN Indonesia co-hosted a symposium at the National Library of Science of Indonesia to explore the role of science to support the SDGs, and to launch the SDG Hub at the University of Indonesia. This Hub was created to encourage a collaborative approach to implementing the SDGs. As one of the world’s largest economies, Indonesia has a critical role to play in the implementation of the SDGs. Not only does Indonesia host some of the most biodiverse-rich forests in the world, but it also maintains a massive greenhouse gas emission stock in its underground peat swamp forests, alongside a growing palm oil industry. Like most countries, Indonesia has much to gain in strategically implementing the SDGs. In order to support this work, many researchers and Universities are coming together to emphasize the role of science and research to support national planning for a sustainable future.
