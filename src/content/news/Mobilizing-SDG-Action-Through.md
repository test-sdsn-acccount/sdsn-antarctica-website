Child marriage has been a serious issue in most of the rural areas in Nepal. This has led to multiple drawbacks from individual to social and from social to economic development paradigm in the Nepalese society. Leaving beside other societal issues, Child marriage has been a ‘need to end’ concern in Nepal.

Nevertheless, there have been some immediate and crucial steps been undertaken by different local leaders and champions around the communities and within the nation. But that is not going to be enough. Because at the end of the day, what matters is the larger impact that has been created in the community through the social movement and actions. There are some ‘takeaways’ to be considered, some messages to be delivered and a growth mindset to be developed. There are various good examples that we can refer to as a model for change. One should not ignore the initiation from Jugal Rural Municipality in Nepal.

Jugal is known to be one of the least developed and remote places in the central part of Nepal. Being the nearest mountain from the city area, there are larger communities near to it who are very isolated from the modern trends and are not aware of the social issues that are hindering their lives. It is not very surprising to learn that there are traditional and customary practices existing yet in such society. Child marriage has been one recurring traditional practice that is yet prevailed in the Jugal and many more such communities in Nepal. We all know how dangerous child marriage could be and how threatening its consequence could be. Although there are some significant changes been observed in Jugal community. Kudos to the Judicial Committee of Jugal Rural Municipality which has been tirelessly working to end child marriage system and alleviate gender-based violence.

On Jan 10, 2020, Judicial committee of Jugal Rural Municipality in Nepal organized its fourth event under the theme of ‘Ending Gender-based violence and child marriage’. Kathmandu University Representatives who are currently working as a local government facilitator in Jugal also participated in the event to support the campaign and deliver the message on ending gender-based violence and child marriage. The committee has been organizing this event as a month-long, weekly campaign by reaching out to each ward that is within Jugal Rural Municipality. The municipality is also looking forward to organizing the campaign in the remaining wards too. The design of the program is very impacting and is occupied with a very firm message that delivers an instinct within the audience to break the stereotypes and start the journey of changes. The Judicial Committee is chaired by the deputy chair of Jugal Rural Municipality, who herself is the core designer of this campaign. One essential aspect of the program was the artistic presentation such as- stories, drama, street play and music rather than heavy speeches. This could easily attract huge masses and deliver informal knowledge to them. The campaigning design is more realistic and practical which also has observed many changes in the last few weeks. The responses from the audiences and the immediate changes seen in the perspective of people are the living impacts observed in the community.

The campaign mobilized local community people and student in each activity of the event. As the centre place for the event was the school, students and teachers from the same school, guardians along with the local community people were key audiences. Youth students and other community people participated as a performer. The program was designed to regard the best one from the competitive performance. This concept was very key to build ownership within the audiences themselves.

> “Youth are the essential gem; it is vital that we need to mobilize local youth to bring immediate changes and sustainable positive impact in the community. This also means that there’s a lot we can change from the bottom of the community if we build ownership within them.” – Srijana Tamang, Deputy Chair, Jugal Rural Municipality

It is indeed very appreciable that the local government are setting good examples within the community to apply bottom-up approaches in changing the trend and ending evil practices that are germinated within the deep root of the community. The goal of achieving Sustainable Development Goals starts from the bottom of the pyramid. And that bottom of the pyramid is where the local youth leaders, local government and civil societies can start with. From the dramatic presentation to the competitive musical presentation from the same local community people and then convincing the audiences and stakeholders in signing the petition is very connected. These approaches are far better than typical road campaigns that are seen and neglected by the outsiders.

Immediately after one event at one of the wards in Jugal, a couple approached and expressed their gratitude to the Deputy Chair for this initiation. Had there not been this event, they would have continued their old practice of child marriage.

> “We were almost ready to prepare our daughter for marriage. If we were not here in this program, we would have done the biggest mistake of our life. Thank you for this greater message.” - Audience

The sense of ownership can widely be seen in such campaigns. The more local people are mobilized and involved in such actions, the more it creates ownership and impacts in their regular lives. Such initiation from other local governments should be promoted such that others can learn lessons from it and replicate similar actions in their spaces. Nepal is on a transition as it was recently structured into the federal system. As we have already observed such positive initiation from the local government from a very challenging geography, it is very genuine to expect other local governments performing similar actions from their end. Achieving Sustainable Development Goals is a complex action, but it is not impossible. There are millions of ways to start with. This event also implies the vital role of local government in contributing to achieving SDGs.
